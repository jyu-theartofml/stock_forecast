# stock_forecast

<p> This is a somewhat cursory script for stock price forecasting using the deep learning recurrent network called LSTM. Just a quick background on this little project - I am not an expert by any means in stock or investing, and the closest I've come to predict future trends is by using well known metrics like MACD and Stochastic Oscillator. After learning about LSTM neural network from Kirill Eremenko's Udemy class <a href="https://www.udemy.com/deeplearning/learn/v4/overview"<i> Deep Learning A-Z </i></a>, I decided to try out one of the homework problems in using LSTM to predict time-series data (stock prices), curious to see if there's any practical value of applying recurrent neural network.

<p> In this predictive model, one hyperparameter of interest is the number of days of prior stock prices used in each sample point. After some preliminary exploration, 3 day of past prices was used. This means that for any given day X<sub>i</sub> in the training set, it contains a vector of Y<sub>i-2</sub>, Y<sub>i-1</sub>, Y<sub>i</sub> corresponding to the closing prices of the last three days. The LSTM model will take this input (with timestep of 3 specified), and yield an output prediction for the next day, X<sub>i+1</sub>.</p>
